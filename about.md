Greetings!

First, I'd like to thank you for visiting! I hope that through your review of my website, I am able to connect with you as a reader in some way, as I continue my career progression as an information security professional. Please feel free to send me any questions, comments and/or feedback by emailing me at the following email address:

Ok, now a little bit about me. I moved to Chicago, IL when I started college in 2009. Right out from highschool, I knew exactly what degree I wanted to pursue, a Bachelor's degree in Accounting from DePaul University. A few quarters into my degree, I realized I needed to bridge the gap between finance/accounting professionals with information systems/technology professionalss. My logic at the time was to declare a double major in accounting and management information systems with a minor in economics. I figured if I know how the accounting stuff works, and I know how economics works, I can convey business processes to information systems professionals and vice versa. Then I graduated in 2014, and landed an internship with a company in the telecommunications industry as an internal audit intern...and I'm still there except doing IT Auditing!

Cool, right?!
Right!

But what's audit?! What's IT audit. Simply put, internal audit teams, within public companies, play a large role in evaluating business process, risk management and compliance initiatives to reduce or eliminate risks to the company, their resources, as well as their customers. Internal audits also provide assurance over the integrity of controls over financial statements. To me, IT audit goes perhaps a level deeper, and evaluates supporting technologies and technical processes that support key business processes. Certainly, there is also a great emphasis on evaluating risk management and compliance initiatives from an IT perspective. Finally, IT audits also help provide assurance over the integrity of controls; however, not solely limited to financial statements, but also the organization's security posture.

## Why information security?! Why now?! Why me?!
Because it's time!!!

practices and share the knowledge I gain throughout my career as an information security professional.
